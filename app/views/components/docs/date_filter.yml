      aria_controls_id adds an [`aria-controls` attribute](https://tink.uk/using-the-aria-controls-attribute/) to each input. This makes it easier for users of assitive tech to jump from them to the part of the page they’re updating.

      The aria_controls_id must be set to the ID of an element that’s on the page or it won’t be included.
    data:
      name: Closed
      key: form-key-2
      aria_controls_id: js-search-results-info
